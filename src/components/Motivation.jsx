        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p>My interest in IT started many years ago in 2000 when I did a course in Practical Programming using Visual Basic and SQL. I found out that I had quite an aptitude for programming and topped the className of 35 with a distinction of 94%.</p>
        <p>I managed to get a job as a Junior Programmer at a company called Clyde Computing in the UK. The company developed in house software for Laboratories and Food companies. Our clients included the NHS Public Health Lab Services and many well know UK food companies such as KP, Birds Eye Walls and many others. My duties included the writing and documentation of methods including reports, batch processes and import/export routines, as well as general system maintenance such as testing, updating, and report and form design.</p>
        <p>At the time I was still in my 20s and an opportunity arose for me to come and work in Cape Town in the film industry. I enjoyed Cape Town and ended up relocating. I now have my very own South African family. LOL.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have contemplated returning back to the IT industry, however having spent many years out of the industry I realised I would need to study and start again in an entry level position which would pay a lot less than what I was earning. Up until recently my wife hasn’t been working and the reality was that I couldn’t afford any type of pay cut.</p>   
        <p>I now find myself a few years on (quite a few) and my circumstances have now changed. The bond on my house is now paid off, my wife is now working full time. Over the past few months (in between juggling a busy work and home life) I have completed an online Full Stack Web Development Course which included HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, GitHub, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, SQL, MongoDB, React.js and more. I have now re-kindled my passion for IT and am keen to keep expanding my knowledge in all areas of IT with a view to re-igniting my career.</p>
        <p>I have excellent written and verbal communication skills. I am an individual who is flexible, adaptable and able to manage multiple priorities at the same time. I can easily work with others in a professional manner while striving to achieve a common goal. I consider myself to be a personable professional and have an ability to build rapport with a diverse workforce in multicultural settings. Having previously run my own business, one of my strongest points is my self-motivation and ability to work independently where necessary. I am able to work under pressure and against aggressive deadlines in a pressurized environment. Being a highly analytical thinker, I am able to quickly identify, scrutinize, improve, and streamline complex work processes.</p>
        <p>Please review my CV and contactable references on this website.</p>
        <p>Kind Regards,</p>
